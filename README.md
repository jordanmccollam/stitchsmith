## Overview
In short, this app will generate a clothing template so you don't have to think about what to wear!
You can tweak the settings in the website so that you only get male clothes or female clothes. 
There is also a weather button, when activated will only give you appropriate clothes for the current weather of your area.
Lastly, the cherry on top, with each clothing template generated, you'll get an optional color scheme to incooperate into your outfit if you choose!

## Motivation / Purpose
As a group, we wanted to make something that would "Take the stress out of getting dressed!" We believe we accomplished this issue by provided a quick and easy way to generate an outfit template. This app is also to showcase our skills with API's, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Future Plans
We hope to expand the idea of Stitch Smith so that rather than generating a general template for an outfit, the user can upload photos of their own clothes and Stitch Smith will generate an outfit based on their actual items.
