## Overview
In short, this app will generate a clothing template so you don't have to think about what to wear!
You can tweak the settings in the website so that you only get male clothes or female clothes. 
There is also a weather button, when activated will only give you appropriate clothes for the current weather of your area.
Lastly, the cherry on top, with each clothing template generated, you'll get an optional color scheme to incooperate into your outfit if you choose!

## Instructions
To use this app simply click the "get started" button on the home page. From there you will be redirected to the outfit generator where you will have a couple options!
* Click generate! Stitch Smith will automatically generate a generic outfit in a split second!
* Enable weather services. Click settings in the top right corner and toggle weather services to on and fill out your location information as prompted. Click generate again and you'll get another random outfit. Only this time, depending on your areas weather, you'll either get primarily warm or cold weather outfits. 
* Change gender preferences! By default, we leave the gender as neutral, everyone has different preferences! However, if you don't want high heels or dresses to be generated, make sure to toggle gender to male by clicking settings in the top right with the corresponding icon. If you don't want guy's clothes, well, you know what to do!
* You'll notice the background is always changing colors as you click generate or reload the page. This is an optional color choice to go with your outfit!
* If you don't like the outfit generated or maybe it doesn't make sense with your style, no problem. Just click generate again.

## Motivation / Purpose
As a group, we wanted to make something that would "Take the stress out of getting dressed!" We believe we accomplished this issue by provided a quick and easy way to generate an outfit template. This app is also to showcase our skills with API's, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Future Plans
We hope to expand the idea of Stitch Smith so that rather than generating a general template for an outfit, the user can upload photos of their own clothes and Stitch Smith will generate an outfit based on their actual items.
